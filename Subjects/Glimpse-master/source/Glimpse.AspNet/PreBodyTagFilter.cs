            // and in that case this method will be called multiple times, which might result in false positives being written to the logs for not finding a </body> 
            // in the current chunk.

            // So we need to be able to deal with the following cases without writing those false positives
            // 1 - the </body> tag is found
            // 2 - the </body> tag was not found because
            //      2.1 - the </body> tag will be available in one of the next calls because the total length of the output is larger than 16K

            //      2.3 - the </body> tag will never be available (is missing)
            //      2.4 - Multiple </body> tags are available of which some might be part of a Javascript string or the markup is badly formatted

            // The easiest way to deal with this is to look for the last match for the </body> tag and if it is found we write everything before it to the
            // output stream and keep that </body> tag and everything that follows it (normally only a </html> tag but it can also be a 2.4 case) for the next call.
            // In case there is no match for the </body> tag, then we write everything to the output stream except for the last 10 characters (normally the last 6 would suffice, but we take a little margin to reassure us somehow ;-)) which we keep until the next call.

            // If there is a next call, then we first prepend the characters we kept from the previous call to the content inside the buffer (which might complete a chunked </body> tag for instance) 
            // and start our check all over again (which might result in finding a </body> tag or discarding a previously found </body> tag because that one was not the last one.
            // Anyhow, as long as we are not a the end and a </body> tag has been found previously, the output will be buffered, just to make sure there is no other </body> tag further down the stream.
