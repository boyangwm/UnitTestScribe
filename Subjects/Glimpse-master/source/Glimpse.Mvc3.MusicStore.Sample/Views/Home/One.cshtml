<h2 class="musicHeadline">Bob Dylan rocks Vietnam in special concert</h2>
<p class="musicArticle">After nearly five decades of singing about a war that continues to haunt a generation of Americans, legendary performer Bob Dylan finally got his chance to see Vietnam at peace. The American folk singer and songwriter known for his anti-war anthems gave a special concert Sunday in the former Saigon, nearly 36 years after the Vietnam War ended. Dylan, 69, jammed on stage in a black jacket, purple shirt and white hat in the warm evening air, singing favorites such as "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Highway 61 Revisited." Only about half of the 8,000 seats at RMIT University were sold to a mix of Vietnamese and foreigners who danced on the grass as Dylan played guitar, harmonica and the keyboard. With more than 60 percent of the country's 86 million people born after the war, many young people here are more familiar with contemporary pop stars like Justin Bieber.</p>
