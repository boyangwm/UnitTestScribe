<h2 class="musicHeadline">Lil Wayne Hasn't Applied For Visa, Rep Says</h2>
<p class="musicArticle">Reports that Lil Wayne is banned from touring Europe due to his inability to obtain a travel visa because of his criminal record are false, MTV News has learned. While the eight months Weezy spent in prison will surely be considered when he seeks to enter the United Kingdom to perform, a representative told us the Young Money CEO has not yet applied for a visa.<br /><br />"No visa was ever filed, nor were there any tour dates announced or tickets sold," a rep from Weezy's tour told MTV News. "Lil Wayne is currently headlining his I Am Still Music Tour across the U.S. and Canada with plans to extend the tour through North America this summer. We hope to bring the I Am Still Music Tour to the U.K. in the later half of the year."<br />For now, the domestic leg of the tour is set to end May 1 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. News of Wayne's intent to extend the tour might affect the talks his current opening act, Nicki Minaj, is having with the Britney Spears camp about joining her Femme Fatale Tour in June. </p>
