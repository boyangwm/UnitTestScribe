<p class="musicArticle">The New Jersey Nets were hit with a hefty $50,000 fine following minority owner Jay-Z's impromptu visit to the locker room of Final Four squad the Kentucky Wildcats last month.<br /><br />The expensive slap on the wrist from NBA officials was due in part to a ruling set in stone by the league that professional team personnel must avoid any contact with collegiate athletes that are not yet draft-eligible. NBA spokesman Tim Frank confirmed the fine Friday (April 8) before the Nets entered a contest with nearby rival squad the New York Knicks at New Jersey's Prudential Center.<br /><br />CBSSports.com broke the initial news of the infraction and the NBA's investigation as video surfaced of Jay-Z congratulating Kentucky team members at the Prudential Center after the squad clinched a Final Four berth by defeating the North Carolina Tarheels.</p>
